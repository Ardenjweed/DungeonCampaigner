# About DungeonCampaigner

Dungeon Campaigner is a graphical user interface built around the TTRPG (table top role playing game) of Dungeons and Dragons. The idea behind this program is that it allows dungeon masters
to import assets that they and players can later interact with directly while playing through their campaign.

# Goal
DungeonCampainger sovles two key issues that I found. 
One issue that I found is that a lot of people who I know would enjoy playing DnD were afraid to begin because of the high barrier of entry and how intmidating it can be in terms of the learning
curve. Having a visual representation of DnD allows newer players to better ease into the world of DnD. 

Another big issue is that DnD can be a big commitment since you need a group of friends that are willing to meet in person, at a desginated spot for several hours, on a repeating schedule. So if
you have any friends that are not right by you and can easily make this commitment you essentially have to kiss goodbye any thoughts of wanting to start a DnD campaign. DungeonCampaigner solves
this issue by allowing people from all over the world to connect to a host and play together from the comfort of their homes.

Finally an issue I've identified from both newer players and older is that there are some tedious aspects of DnD that can really take away from the things that they enjoy the most about DnD. 
For example while rolling to see your attack can be exciting, doing the manual calculations and keeping track of these stats throughout the game can be annoying. This said I know that some 
still enjoy this oldschool feel to the game so our program takes this into considertion and allows each individual user to pick between making their own rolls in real life or having the game 
do the roll for them during their action.
